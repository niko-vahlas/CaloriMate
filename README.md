<h1>CaloriMate</h1>

<h3>Why:</h3>

<p>I've decided to create a web-based maintenance calorie estimator. I've tracked my diet and exercise habits over the last 5 years to optimize my strength, muscle gains, and overall fitness. I've typically used mobile applications like MyFitnessPal, but I realized there was a need for a more targeted web application that specifically calculates maintenance calories based on personal dietary and weight data.</p>

<p>This project is intended for anyone aiming to understand their personal maintenance calories â€“ whether they aim to lose weight, gain weight, or just become more cognizant of their caloric balance.</p>

<h4>User Stories</h4>
<ul>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to input my daily caloric intake.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to input my daily weight measurements.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to see an estimate of my maintenance calories based on the data I input.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to see how my estimated maintenance calories change over time.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to store my data for future reference.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want the flexibility to input data for any given day, not just consecutive days.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to access my account from any device.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user interface and back-end of CaloriMate will be designed from scratch, utilizing the latest in web development technologies to provide an optimal user experience.</p>
